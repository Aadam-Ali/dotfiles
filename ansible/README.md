# Ansible Playbook

An Ansible playbook written to setup my development environment on
Debian based Linux distros and MacOS.

Currently this installs all essential packages and files that I use across all my development environments.

More recently, I've been updating the Debian tasks and vars to setup my desktop environment: `i3` and `rofi`.
