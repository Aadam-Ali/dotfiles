# Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles for my development environment, as well as an Ansible role to bootstrap the machines / VMs that I use. I've tried my best to account for MacOS, Debian, Ubuntu, and more recently (and experimentally) PopOS.

Feel free to try out my dotfiles, however, be warned that you may need
to tweak a few things here and there to make them work for you as they are
configured for my setup(s) i.e. references to my username.

### Setup

To set up these dotfiles simple run:
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aadam-Ali/dotfiles/main/scripts/dot)
```
OR
```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aadam-Ali/dotfiles/main/scripts/dot)
```
