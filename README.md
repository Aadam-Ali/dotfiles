# My dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for various applications /
utilities. When writing my dotfiles I try to write them in such a way
that they should be cross compatible with Linux and MacOS.

Feel free to try out my dotfiles, however, be warned that you may need
to tweak a few things here and there to make them work for as they are
configured for my setup(s).

### Setup

To set up these dotfiles simple run:
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aadam-Ali/dotfiles/main/scripts/dot)
```
OR
```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aadam-Ali/dotfiles/main/scripts/dot)
```
